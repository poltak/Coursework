Various Operating System-based assignments demonstrating concepts such as process
forking, multi-threading and timing analysis on varying amounts of threads,
and a custom memory allocating algorithm (random fit).

fsh         -- Basic UNIX shell wrapper demonstrating forking of processes and some
            other things I am yet to remember.

sumthreads  -- Computes a summation of the squares of n threads. Timing analysis
            not included.

randomfit   -- Personal memory allocation algorithm. Very silly concept, but was
            useful for learning about memory allocation and analysing popular
            allocation algorithms.

TODO (some day):
- Fix some terrible formatting inconsistencies that I seemed to have during this
time.
- Fix up some warnings lint threw at me after going over this stuff.
- See if I can do anything useful with anything in this mess (?)
