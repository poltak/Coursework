Data Structures and Algorithms
==============================

Contains JavaSE 1.7 implementations for algorithms and data structures such as a __Skip List__, __Matrix
Multiplications__, __Huffman Code Generator__, __Disjoint Sets__, __Bipartite Graph Checking__, Graphs modelled using
__Adjacency Lists__.

####Note
Many of these were written some time ago and may or may not have fully implemented and tested features. I am actively
trying to bring these up to my current standards and work as the data structures or algorithms are specified.
